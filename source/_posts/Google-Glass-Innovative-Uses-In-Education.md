Google Glass is normally finding its approach into nearly every industry, with applications in healthcare, construction, video games, tourism, and police. Gartner believes that smartglasses helps you to save the field provider industry $1 billion per year. One domain that's specifically ripe for Google Glass innovation is normally education. I spoke with Brian A. Rellinger, CIO Ohio Wesleyan University about the ways Glass can be utilised on campus. The OWU Facts Services Section purchased Google Cup in March, 2014 and started brainstorming about methods to utilize it with a cross section of campus groups. Since Cup is a fresh technology, the ideas continue steadily to multiply as persons gain hands-on experience. Even so, the faculty, personnel, and pupils at OWU developed a diverse set of initial ideas.

Based on the OWU list, listed below are 14 ways that Google Glass can improve higher education. Each idea may well not be a fit for every campus, but hopefully it can benefit start the debate for brand-new or potential Cup owners. Do you have more ideas? Feel free to tweet them to us at @ValaAfshar and @rellinb.

- Incorporate Glass into university athletics. Football, baseball, basketball players, for instance, can wear Cup during practice. The trainer can provide them realtime guidelines. Players can viewpoint recordings to comprehend their head and physique movements. As well, spectators can become a member of the hangout to see the sport from the player's primary person point of view. Tennis and football QB examples.
- Question alumni or others to have on Glass during performances in the arts and various other extreme professional activities, so pupils can experience the effectiveness and take part remotely. See video tutorial with chef Roy Choi.
- Give college students realtime interactive (and subsequently documented) field trip experience to difficult-to-reach places just like the Significant Hadron Collider (CERN); the Oval Office; a battle zone; Federal Reserve Lender; Mt. Everest; Tibet, Papua, New Guinea; Cheyenne Mountain; Antarctica; Egyptian pyramids.
- Professor can put on Glass during lectures and open up a hangout so pupils can take part remotely. Glass may also provide a back-up learning resource to the professor to contact more detailed impromptu articles as required by college student questions. May also be employed by student teachers to greatly help them as they learn to teach.
- Experiment with QR codes around campus to display location specific facts, such as classes educated in a specific room. Google Cup quickly interprets the QR codes.
- Students sitting in lectures can use Glass to support take down notes and bookmark essential passages, as well as to view extra-classroom content offered to them by the lecturing professor. Cup can provide realtime vocabulary translation for foreign pupils.
- Lend to visiting learners and leads for self-guided tours of the campus. Cup will (with added operation) automatically explain landmarks within the student's vision, explain history, and answer concerns.
- Invite remote possible pupils to tour the campus with a live Hangout with a Glass-wearing guide.
- Provide a simulated (virtual certainty) experience to pupils of intense events such as in an operating space, on the athletic discipline, or in outer space. In these cases, the wearer may be the one directly taking part in the simulation, instead of watching as another person participates.
- Provide live first-person connection with graduation, by having students wear Google Glass throughout the ceremony and convocation.
- Professors may use Glass to get questions from students during their lectures. Andrew Perlman of Suffolk University Law College describes how students who could be reluctant to speak up in course can text their issues right to the professor who sights the texts with Cup. It is even feasible to poll the pupil crowd to see if they are grasping difficult concepts through the lecture.
- Professors and instructors can use a Glassware application like Speech Helper to see their slide notes throughout a slide show display and can as well control the slides ('Ok, glass. Slide Remote').
- Create a study course or club to instruct students how exactly to design Glassware apps.
- Create a Glassware app to have attendance and pull recent grades of college students to assist faculty in the classroom.

There is another aspect to Google Cup and other wearables in education which has a disruptive effect on what college students are taught and how they are tested. Stephen diFilipo, CIO at Cecil University, notes that, 'with wearables every test turns into open book. The phrase don't teach that that can be Googled has turned into a familiar cry for those advancing education reform'.

Melissa Woo, Vice Provost for Details Products and services and CIO at the University of Oregon and an early on Google Glass Explorer stresses that advanced schooling has a vital role to take up in neuro-scientific wearable computing, that runs beyond simply using the technology: 'Advanced schooling is a significant area for experimentation with Glass and other wearables, not merely because they promote teaching, but because they support us understand how we should best connect to and incorporate these technology into our society's future'.

Google halts revenue of Google Glass

Google to discontinue its wise glasses, Google Glass, found in setback for US technology company

Google has halted product sales of its much-hyped Google Cup headset in a major U-convert for the technology business.

THE UNITED STATES giant confirmed on Thursday night that it'll stop selling the £1,000 smart glasses in a few days, just months after launching in the united kingdom. The company may also discontinue its 'Explorer' program - the purpose of which was to see how people applied the technology and to gather their feedback.

On the other hand, Google insisted it is not abandoning the project completely. The business will continue to spend money on its Glass at Work offering for business developers and companies, and plans release a a new release of its wearable product "if it is ready".

The Google Cup team, led by Ivy Ross, will be moved from the Google X division, where Google projects are incubated, and be its own entity within Google.

Ms Ross and the Glass team will are accountable to Tony Fadell, founder and leader of good thermostat maker Nest Labs, that was acquired by Google a year ago.

Moving a task out of Google X generally happens whenever a product "matures". Other projects have already been through an identical process, such as for example Indoor Maps, that was shifted to the 'Geo' crew once it revealed momentum, and Google Human brain, which relocated to the 'Knowledge' team.

However, analysts and sector commentators said the approach was a backward step.

Nicky Danino, senior lecturer on computing at the University of Central Lancashire, said: "It’s patently clear that Google released the product before it will have. People spent lots of money to obtain the ‘beta’ version, however when they truly did, there’s wasn't many they are able to do with it.

"Personally I think that the biggest disappointment is the insufficient apps for it. For me, Google must have kept this job under wraps for much longer and waited to release when it had been more reliable, and had various other uses."

Despite having experienced development for over 3 years, Google Glass continues to be officially a prototype. It continued sale in the united kingdom in June 2014, with a cost tag of £1,000, but Google explained that it could continue focus on it before which makes it available to buyers in other countries.

A month afterwards, Babak Parviz, the architect behind Google Cup, announced he was leaving the company for employment as vice president at Amazon. Two key Google Glass executives - Adrian Wong, chief of electrical engineering, and Ossama Alami, director of developer relations - also departed.

Meanwhile, several firms, including Twitter, stopped working on applications for Google Glass. In a straw poll of 16 Glass iphone app manufacturers by Reuters in November, nine said that they had stopped work on their jobs or abandoned them, generally because of having less customers or constraints of the device.

Google itself will not release sales statistics for Glass. Nevertheless, the high price tag and limited features have deterred many buyers.

Despite the best work of fashion designers, like Diane von Furstenberg and Luxottica (the business behind Ray-Ban and Oakley), Google Glass has didn't get rid of its nerdy image, because of the prism-like display that juts right out of the frame and sits in front of the zoom lens on any pair of glasses.

Glass in addition has been beset with controversy, due to the capability of the wearer to take photos and record video clips surreptitiously. Bars in San Francisco have started banning persons from wearing Cup, after some attacks on users, and these devices in addition has been banned in cars, cinemas, casinos, hospitals and banks.

Earlier this season, Google went as far as to concern an etiquette guideline for users of its Glass headsets, urging them never to be 'Glassholes', and be respectful and polite while wearing the headphones.

"I think the idea of Google Glass is a robust one, and should certainly not be dismissed lightly. My expectation is that corporations that exploration and develop wearable technology will keep creating and innovating," explained Ms Danino.

"The future should be streamlined and unobtrusive. Technology should integrate seamlessly with existence, rather than awkwardly interrupt it."

Google is set to popularise Google Cup, positioning it not as an ‘uber-geek’ item but rather a single that the average indivdual on the road can relate with and, more importantly, afford. Traditionally, new item innovations have years to refine before growing to be mainstream. In this thriving technological period, however, it really is clear that this transition period features shortened dramatically. Google and its own partners are focused on making Glass open to mass consumers as early as the finish of 2014.

While wearable goods exude an air of novelty which attracts various, Euromonitor International talks about whether the marketplace is really prepared to embrace this latest technology.

Are Consumers Ready for the Cup Invasion?
Once getting over the initial excitement surrounding Glass, one may start to wonder about the repercussions of the system becoming mainstream, such as for example whether eye health will learn to deteriorate with prolonged consumption, the safety of motorists when more drivers begin using Cup and privacy problems with regard to what is appropriate usage behaviour.

Privacy and Safety Issues
As a society, privacy and safety are fundamental concerns in terms of latest technology. Where carry out we draw the line between socially suitable and unacceptable behaviour and who will govern this? Currently the unfavorable term ‘Glasshole’ has been coined to describe a person who will not use the device in a socially suitable manner. There happen to be cafés and public places which outwardly prohibit the application of Glass on their premises, while a further campaign launched in america called ‘End the Cyborgs’ encourages limiting the consumption of Cup in public areas and private establishments.

Safety on the highway is also a problem. Many would agree that significant amounts of accidents could be avoided if motorists and pedestrians were not being distracted by equipment while on the road. Although one might argue that Cup will release one’s hands, which different mobile devices potentially do not without a hands-free system, having content appear in front side of one’s eyes may very well be a distraction. THE UNITED KINGDOM government, which currently bans the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving, has been among the first to likewise ban the utilization of Glass while driving. A driver located doing this would incur a set penalty see and a tips deduction on his/her licence.

Evolution in Progress
Irrespective of legislation, Glass poses a tricky quandary because of its eyewear design. With the expected commoditisation of the merchandise, it is likely to evolve and become less prominent, thus which makes it difficult for traffic enforcers to be able to identify motorists wearing such eyewear. Furthermore, what constitutes use? If a motorist wears Glass and uses it purely because of its prescriptive goal and will not switch the pc component on, will this count as usage? Again, that is area making enforcing the ban complicated.

Much like any new innovation, Cup will face many difficulties going forward. A lack of forerunner goods means uncertainty for both buyers and marketers. Maintaining the rapid quickness of product introductions may bring about more apprehension than adoption among mass customers in the early stages. Nevertheless, the potential and attractiveness of this new technology is certainly unlikely to falter in the short term. I expect brand-new legislation and social acceptance to finally support this product, and one can only expectation that even more breakthrough and meaningful usages of the device can make this technology worthwhile.

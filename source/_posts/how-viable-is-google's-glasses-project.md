## Google Glasses Transformation Tech Industry's Perspective

Geordi La Forge. Vegeta. For the longest period, high-tech eyewear possesses been the domain of science fiction stalwarts and Saiyans. With Google's unveiling of a brilliant sleek group of eyeglasses, however, the continuing future of geeky eyewear only got a bit closer. Referred to officially as Google's 'Project Cup', the lightweight device marries the functions of a smartphone to a set of, well, glasses - featuring an interactive heads-up screen for users.

Video recording released by Google of the way the device may potentially work reveal a variety of capabilities. Included in these are answering messages, setting reminders, finding locations, taking photos and training video chat. For insight, the wearer may use either voice commands or side motions. Sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it?

## Such as a Smartphone or Tablet on Your Face

While many of these aforementioned features sound exactly like you skill with your phone right now, the interface is what seriously sets this particular piece of tech apart. Rather than whipping out a phone or tablet and having everything confined within those device's screens, the Google glasses virtually put everything inside your viewpoint. The applications for this interface may seem strange at first, but the potential seriously starts to crystallize once you start to see the issue in action. Predicated on the potential uses demoed by Google's video theory, the interactivity and utility which can be supplied by the glasses is in fact quite cool.

You can have a pal buzz you and have if you want to meet, for example, and you could simply answer back by voicing out your response - maybe throw out a period and place - and it'll be sent back to the individual who just contacted you. The Google glasses application (a variant of Android perhaps?) can also transcribe what you say in the process.

## A Fresh Sense of Direction

Building on the previous example, once you decide where to encounter, the glasses can give you guidelines to where you intend to go, providing notifications for things such as construction or perhaps transportation alerts. Besides street-based location products and services, the software can even be fine-tuned to map out the interiors of properties and businesses. Google's theory video, for example, displays the glasses providing guidelines to a specific section of a bookstore. On the other hand, also you can get improvements on the positioning of a pal you've assembly, provided they talk about it with you, of training course.

## Acquiring Photos and Checking In

The Google glasses seem to be particularly useful when you've on trips or traveling. Personally, this is when I have a tendency to take more images and use social media, so it comes as no surprise. As being a smartphone, you can use the glasses to have pictures and immediately show them with close friends. Also you can check in at a particular location for instance a restaurant and talk about that to your circle of good friends as well. See something interesting like a poster for a concert you would like to have a look at later? You can tone of voice out a reminder for that if you wish. In a sense, the glasses practically function like a secretary.

## Still a Work Happening

As the concept is admittedly cool, it is merely that - a concept. That means details for the ultimate version remain sketchy, and this device could finish up being something completely different or not even pan out at all.

Even if it can end up exactly like it is demoed, there even now are issues that need to be addressed. What would the effect of the device be on vision, especially for folks with certain health conditions? Can it be as well distracting and potentially reason accidents? Is today's tone of voice recognition software accurate more than enough to capture all speech? And can people be ready to wear these varieties of glasses for a protracted period of time?

As with any brand-new tech, such kinks should be worked out. For all its potential issues, however, Google's Job Glass sounds like something with plenty of potential.

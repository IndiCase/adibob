## Google Glass product finally finds a make use of case in the enterprise

Understand the situation first, then invent the technology -- unless you're Google and the technology is its Google Glass device. Also: KRACK assault, AlphaGo Zero, IoT reliability strategies increasing.

At the recent Business Wearable Technology Summit in Boston, Mass., speaker after speaker emphasized a very important factor most importantly: Technology can be for naught in the event that you aren't solving a specific business problem.

"Ensure that you first understand what the situation truly is, then develop the very best organization practice for how to address that difficulty," said Brian Laughlin, IT architect of cellular devices and professional aviation services in Boeing, at the event. "Then and only in that case can you apply the correct technology."

In terms of Google, whose engineering team was at the conference to talk about the business's Google Glass device, the sage advice applies -- and doesn't.

With the development of Google Glass, the optical head-mounted display that appears like some eyeglasses, the search giant appears to have operated in the reverse, inventing a device that had to find the problem it had been meant to solve.

Focus on Google's assisted-fact eyewear certainly started out with a concept of a difficulty to solve, said Jay Kothari, job lead for Glass in X, the moonshot factory. The ambition was to fix "the information overload issue." If Google engineers could put the world's information in your type of sight, in that case everyone on the globe would be scrambling to get their hands on it.

That didn't happen, Kothari said. Since Google didn't really really know what problem it was trying to fix with Glass, its engineers considered "Explorers" -- qualified early on adaptors -- to figure out the device's raison d'etre for them.

"The Explorer program was an experiment for all of us to take Cup, put it available in the market as a piece of technology and ask 'what would you conduct with this technology?' 'What is this finally valuable for?'" Kothari said. But the quest struck a dead end. "We got such a broad group of answers" -- none of which pointed to a work with circumstance that justified the device's living in the buyer market.

## A new chapter for the Google Glass project

But at Google, generally there are no failures, simply course corrections.

If the buyer space was a bust, then why not take this phenomenal solution for a issue that no person besides Google engineers seemingly wished to solve and try it out on ... the enterprise. Eureka.

"We gone from what we assumed was a good consumer fashion gadget to something that's incredibly function-oriented and includes a very clear use circumstance," Kothari said. Again, the team first had to determine what those "clear work with cases" in the business would be.

Doing work with Explorers in a number of industries, the Google team eventually discovered what its nifty creation was designed to do on the globe, Kothari explained. "We didn't know sectors. We needed to study them. By making [Glass] broadly available and allowing people to experiment, we were able to see what people were able to do."

The biggest impact is being observed in jobs where people have to have their hands free, Kothari said. Staff, for instance, can view guidelines with video clips, animations and images right within their line of sight, and don't have to stop and talk to a binder or pc to know what to do next. Manufacturing, logistics, discipline service or mend, and healthcare will be the four main sectors Glass is targeted on today, he said.

The team also took a diverse approach to selling this technology. Kothari stated they never talked about the technology; they talked about what the technology could perform for a particular enterprise or use circumstance. Google possesses partnered with around 50 businesses, incorporating GE, DHL, Dignity Overall health, The Boeing Enterprise and Volkswagen.

A revamped Google Cup device -- with an increase of power and better electric battery lifestyle -- has improved GE's mechanics' efficiency by around 8% and 12%. Package deal sorters at DHL possess increased their proficiency by 15% by getting information projected to their type of sight via Glass, freeing up their hands. Doctors at Dignity Wellbeing have reduced the time they spend typing up individual notes and various other administrative work by 33% by using Cup, Kothari touted, adding that Cup has identified its groove and can be moving full-steam ahead.

## The 'Glasshole' effect 

What's the lesson the Google Cup project team discovered from its wearable voyage? It circles back to the need to solve a particular problem for the end user, explained Melvin Chua, an executive in business development at Glass.

"With any kind of new technology, to get adoption and roll out of development you absolutely need the ROI," Chua said during the keynote.

"Actually if the managers wanted this and whether or not there was an excellent business circumstance behind it, if we couldn't meet the wearers -- their desires and needs -- they might not set this on when they visited work."

Chua also found that when screening new wearable technology on users, it is important to find people who will consistently use the device.

Your face may be the most expensive human property there is, so putting something people don't feel great wearing is tough.

From a hardware perspective, the team also discovered that people cared about what it feels as though to wear the device and how they look when wearing it.

"Your face may be the most expensive human being property there is, thus putting something persons don't feel good wearing is tough," Kothari said.

In the consumer pilot, for example, Glass wearers were dubbed "Glassholes" by a derisive public, which certainly didn't help users feel good about wearing these devices.

"We spend lots of time grappling with the public impacts of putting a laptop and a camera on somebody's deal with," Kothari said.

## CIO reports roundup for week of Oct 16th

The Google Glass device's journey to the enterprise wasn't the only interesting tech news this week. Some tips about what else made headlines:

IoT-specific security strategies on the rise. The Global Condition of Information Security Study 2018 executed by auditing firm PwC determined organizations are implementing plans and technologies to handle IoT-related dangers. Sixty-seven percent of the respondents said they have an IoT security strategy set up or are implementing one. The survey drew on responses from 9,500 executives in a lot more than 75 sectors worldwide, and found 29% of respondents believe CISOs should bear responsibility for IoT reliability. Business leaders are as well aware of the risks linked with emerging technologies, the study discovered. Forty percent of respondents from agencies using automation or robotics explained operations disruption would come to be the main consequence of a cyberattack on those devices, followed by reduction or compromise of sensitive info (39%) and harm to quality of goods produced (32%).

WPA2 vulnerability. Belgian protection professional Mathy Vanhoef has learned a vulnerability in WPA2, a protocol utilized to protect Wi-Fi connections all over the world. The attack functions against all contemporary protected Wi-Fi systems, Vanhoef stated in a report released this week. "An attacker within range of a victim can exploit these weaknesses employing important reinstallation attacks. Attackers can use this novel assault technique to read info that once was assumed to come to be safely encrypted," based on the article. The vulnerability can be exploited to steal sensitive details like credit card quantities, passwords, chat messages, emails and photographs, and an attacker may also have the ability to inject ransomware or other malware into websites, Vanhoef explained in the report.

Google unveils self-taught AI. On Wednesday, Google's AI division referred to as DeepMind unveiled a robust computer course dubbed AlphaGo Zero. This program is the latest evolution of AlphaGo, and DeepMind developers stated it won't come to be "constrained by the limits of human understanding." The AlphaGo Zero software progressively learned the overall game of Move from scratch and were able to accumulate a large number of years of individual knowledge within times, according to developers. "Earlier versions of AlphaGo at first trained on a large number of individual amateur and professional games to discover ways to take up Get. AlphaGo Zero skips this step and learns to take up simply by doing offers against itself, beginning with completely random take up," according to a DeepMind blog post.
